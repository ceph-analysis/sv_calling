## installed manta from github releases. 

To make the bams work with per-family calling, I have to get them into a consistent reference structure. 
I will reheader the ones without phiX for consistency and store them in my own data directory

update: Julie requested that the files be re-aligned. I will run a single family now and then some back to the analysis later
